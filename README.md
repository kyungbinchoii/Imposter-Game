# The Imposter Game

A web application where users can play a game of a mafia style game where the imposter doesn't know the word given to the rest of the players.
CAN YOU GUESS WHO IS THE IMPOSTER? 

###### Created using React, TypeScript, Express.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL.

## Why I built this

I love mafia/imposter style games like Among Us, so I wanted to create a fun project without implementing Socket.io. 

## ðŸ”— Live Demo

Try the game here: http://ec2-54-145-83-38.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

## ðŸ“– Features
- Users can host a game as a host by creating a username, a unique game pin, and selecting a category which will provide the non-imposters the word.
- Users can join the host's lobby by entering a username and the unique game pin provided by the host.
- Users can submit a hint of what the word is and vote out who they think is the imposter.
- Users can press the refresh button to update the words and the votes to show the outcome.
